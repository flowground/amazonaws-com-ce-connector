After AWS has these categories, it simulates every\ncombination of reservations in each category of usage to identify the best\nnumber of each type of RI to purchase to maximize your estimated savings. \n\nFor example, AWS automatically aggregates your Amazon EC2 Linux, shared tenancy,\nand c4 family usage in the US West (Oregon) Region and recommends that you buy\nsize-flexible regional reservations to apply to the c4 family usage. AWS\nrecommends the smallest size instance in an instance family. This makes it\neasier to purchase a size-flexible RI. AWS also shows the equal number of\nnormalized units so that you can purchase any instance size that you want. For\nthis example, your RI recommendation would be for c4.large because that is the\nsmallest size instance in the c4 instance family.",

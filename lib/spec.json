After AWS has these categories, it simulates every combination of reservations in each category of usage to identify the best number of each type of RI to purchase to maximize your estimated savings. </p> <p>For example, AWS automatically aggregates your Amazon EC2 Linux, shared tenancy, and c4 family usage in the US West (Oregon) Region and recommends that you buy size-flexible regional reservations to apply to the c4 family usage. AWS recommends the smallest size instance in an instance family. This makes it easier to purchase a size-flexible RI. AWS also shows the equal number of normalized units so that you can purchase any instance size that you want. For this example, your RI recommendation would be for <code>c4.large</code> because that is the smallest size instance in the c4 instance family.</p>",

For example, you can filter for <code>INSTANCE_TYPE==m4.xlarge OR INSTANCE_TYPE==c4.large</code>. The <code>Expression</code> for that looks like this:</p> <p> <code>{ \"Dimensions\": { \"Key\": \"INSTANCE_TYPE\", \"Values\": [ \"m4.xlarge\", “c4.large” ] } }</code> </p> <p>The list of dimension values are OR'd together to retrieve cost or usage data. You can create <code>Expression</code> and <code>DimensionValues</code> objects using either <code>with*</code> methods or <code>set*</code> methods in multiple lines. </p> </li> <li> <p>Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can use multiple <code>Expression</code> types and the logical operators <code>AND/OR/NOT</code> to create a list of one or more <code>Expression</code> objects. This allows you to filter on more advanced options. For example, you can filter on <code>((INSTANCE_TYPE == m4.large OR INSTANCE_TYPE == m3.large) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer)</code>.
